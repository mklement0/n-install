# SYNOPSIS
#   echoColored colorNum [text...]
# DESCRIPTION
#   Prints input in the specified color, which must be an ANSI color code (e.g., 31 for red).
#   Input is either provided via the TEXT operands, or, in their absence, from stdin.
#   If input is provided via TXT operands, a trailing \n is added.
#   NOTE: 
#     - Unlike echo, uses stdin, if no TEXT arguments are specified; you MUST either specify
#       at least one input operand OR stdin input; in that sense, this function is like a hybrid
#       between echo and cat. However, *interactive* stdin input makes no sense, and therefore
#       a newline is simply printed - as with echo without arguments - if stdin is connected to
#       a terminal and neither operands nor stdin input is provided.
#     - Coloring is suppressed, if the variable kNO_COLOR exists and is set to 1.
#       An invoking script may set this in case output is NOT being sent to a terminal.
#       (E.g., test -t 1 || kNO_COLOR=1)
# EXAMPLES
#   echoColored 31 "I'm red"
#   cat file | echoColored 32 # file contents is printed in green
echoColored() {
  local pre="\033[${1}m" post='\033[0m'
  (( kNO_COLOR )) && { pre= post=; }
  shift # skip the color argument
  if (( $# )); then
    printf "${pre}%s${post}\n" "$*"
  else
    [[ -t 0 ]] && { printf '\n'; return; } # no interactive stdin input
    printf "$pre"; cat; printf "$post"
  fi  
}

# -- Coloring convenience output functions
#    They're based on echoColored(), and thus take either operands or stdin input.
#    If input is provided via arguments, a trailing \n is added.

# SYNOPSIS

# DESCRIPTION

#   first argument specifies the message to print.
#   Either way, a preamble with this script's name and the type of message is printed.

SYNOPSIS
  $kTHIS_NAME [-y]

DESCRIPTION
  Uninstalls n, the Node.js version manager, assuming it was originally
  installed with $kINSTALLER_NAME.

  CAUTION: n, along with all its Nodej.js and io.js versions is REMOVED.

  n is expected to be located in:

    \${N_PREFIX}

  whose current value is:

    ${N_PREFIX}

  For safety reasons, the uninstallation is only performed if the expected
  modifications performed by $kINSTALLER_NAME are found in the current user's
  shell initialization file.
  Otherwise, manual uninstallation instructions are provided, including for
  shells that $kINSTALLER_NAME didn't support.

  Options:

    -y
      USE WITH CAUTION: Skips the confirmation prompt and uninstalls
      instantly.
